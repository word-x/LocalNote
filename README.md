## Why do we created LocalNote?
We attempted to use Wordpress as our local note-taking tool, but when our notes exceeded 2,000, it became heavy and slow. Subsequently, we tried other software like CherryTree, Notepad++, Joplin, Obsidian, etc. Although these products are excellent, but they have too much features that slow down their speed and use too much resouces.

What we want is a light-weight and super fast note software based on browser that supports any system. Because everyone has a browser installed either on their phone/tablet or PC, and we use browser almost every day. We don't need to open a new software window. What we need is just a new tab in browser.

## Philosophy
- Think before write: Although LocalNote is lightweight and fast, it's crucial to avoid recording insignificant content. Simplify the contents mainly in brain, and use LocalNote to keep it.
- Use text first, not image: Of course, we support inserting images but once you have several throunds of posts with many images attached, you'll probably not view those images again. This happens to your smart phone's gallery that we took a lot of photos every week but most rarely get a second look. 

## Target users
- Try to find a multi-platform note app that supports Windows/Mac/Linux/Android/iOS and other OS with browser installed.
- Users who enjoy jotting down work notes, personal diaries, or ideas.
- Users who dislike complexity and embrace minimalism.
